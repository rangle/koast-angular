This directory contains a client-side bower component for accessing Koast from
AngularJS. Strictly speaking, you don't need this to use Koast, but AngularJS
services provided by this module should save you some work.

This would normally be installed using bower or npm. To use the git version,
however, use "bower link" or "npm link".

### bower

```shell
bower install koast-angular
```

### npm
```shell
npm install koast-angular
```
